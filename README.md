<p>This is Dictionary Program made for my Computer Workshop class.<br>
It's uses the JavaFX framework for UI and Oracle Database for storing the Words. It
has the option to add word as well as delete them. for best use import a csv dictionary before hand to your database. I
imported
<a link=https://github.com/benjihillard/English-Dictionary-Database/blob/main/english%20Dictionary.csv>this
dictionary</a>
to the database for demonstration purposes.<br></p>
<p style="color:tomato;">currently only supports one dictionary mode.</p>
